The Stock Exchange Hotel – Level 2 becomes a private lounge with soft lighting, curated playlists, and bilingual hosts who honour cultural etiquette. We pause direct contact exchange during the event so that every guest experiences the same caring and fair environment—our concierge reconnects you only when mutual interest is confirmed.\n\n## What happens during the night\n### Welcome and orientation\nArrive in Smart Casual style ten minutes early for a welcome drink and briefing from the Lounge Asia team. We remind everyone of our tagline—**Connecting hearts across Asian cultures.**\n\n### Mini conversations with heart\nAcross the evening you will enjoy several six-minute chats with carefully balanced pairings. Our hosts supply conversation prompts inspired by Asian food, travel, and family traditions so you can relax and stay authentic.\n\n### Reflection interlude\nMidway we pause for light canapés and invite you to note the guests who felt special. Honest reflections make the concierge follow-up smoother.\n\n## How to prepare for success\n- **Choose Smart Casual layers** that feel elegant yet comfortable; think tailored blazers, silky blouses, or polished loafers.\n- **Bring one cultural story**—a Lunar New Year memory, a family recipe, or a language-learning moment always sparks smiles.\n- **Trust the process.** Contact details stay with the team until morning to keep the experience fair and soothing for everyone.\n\n## Join the waitlist today\nReserve your seat or join the waitlist so our concierge can guide you to the next Comfort and Romance gathering. After the event we will reach out privately if a mutual match appears and help plan your follow-up date.\n\n## Official information\n- **Host:** Lounge Asia (Brisbane’s largest Asian community, 500+ members)\n- **Theme:** Comfort and Romance\n- **Venue:** The Stock Exchange Hotel – Level 2\n- **Dress code:** Smart Casual\n- **Tagline:** Connecting hearts across Asian cultures.\n- **Contact policy:** Contact exchange occurs after the event once our concierge confirms a mutual match.\n\n## Related Articles\n- Placeholder"
