## Why choose Lounge Asia speed dating

### Designed for Asian singles
With more than 500 members, Lounge Asia is Brisbane’s largest Asian community. Each guest is welcomed personally so the room stays friendly and respectful.

### Comfort and Romance settings
The Stock Exchange Hotel – Level 2 becomes our private lounge. Smart casual outfits, candlelight, and curated playlists help you feel calm while sparks fly.

### Fair and transparent
We pause contact exchange during the event to keep things comfortable. After every round, guests mark their matches; our team only shares details if the interest is mutual.

## How an evening flows

### Arrival and welcome
Arrive 15 minutes early for a welcome drink, check-in, and a quick briefing about the schedule.

### Guided conversations
You will enjoy 6–8 mini conversations, each lasting around six minutes. Hosts provide prompt cards so silence never lingers.

### Reflection break
Midway through the night we reset the room, serve light bites, and invite you to note potential matches in a private card.

## Success tips for the night

### Prepare two stories
Share a favourite meal, festival memory, or travel highlight. Personal stories make conversations memorable.

### Blend polish with comfort
Smart casual might mean a soft blazer, chic jumpsuit, or tailored trousers. The goal is elegance plus ease.

### Follow our tagline
Remember the promise: “Connecting hearts across Asian cultures.” A curious mind and respectful tone go a long way.

## Secure your seat today
Join the waitlist or confirm your ticket now. Our concierge will reach out after the event if a mutual match appears, keeping every guest confident and cared for.
