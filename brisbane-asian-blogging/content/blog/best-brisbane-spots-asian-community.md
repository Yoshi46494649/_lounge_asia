Brisbane is filled with romantic nooks, lively food quarters, and riverside walks that suit the Lounge Asia lifestyle. Here are our favourite locations for Comfort and Romance style hangouts that respect Asian cultures and let connection bloom naturally.

## Sunnybank: heart of flavours

### Dinner strolls with new friends
Join a Lounge Asia walking dinner that threads through Sunnybank Plaza’s laneways. We pair guests thoughtfully so conversations stay relaxed while sharing dumplings, skewers, and desserts.

### Late-night dessert lounges
Our Comfort and Romance dessert clubs meet at pastel-toned cafés with soft lighting. Smart casual dress helps photos look polished without being over the top.

## Riverside moments

### Story Bridge twilight walk
We start at The Stock Exchange Hotel – Level 2 for a welcome drink, then guide guests along the river. The skyline becomes a backdrop for easy, meaningful conversation.

### Kangaroo Point picnic circles
Bring a light throw, your favourite tea, and stories from home. Our hosts guide icebreakers that honour the tagline “Connecting hearts across Asian cultures.”

## Hidden cultural corners

### Gallery and craft nights
West End studios often host Asian-Australian artists. Lounge Asia arranges private viewings so you can chat with creatives without big crowds.

### Language swap cafés
In New Farm and Fortitude Valley we partner with boutique cafés for bilingual evenings. Contact exchange waits until after the event so everyone feels equally respected.

## Plan your Lounge Asia outing
Reserve your place at an upcoming Comfort and Romance gathering or join the waitlist. Our concierge will suggest outfits, arrival timing, and conversation starters so you can focus on genuine connection.
