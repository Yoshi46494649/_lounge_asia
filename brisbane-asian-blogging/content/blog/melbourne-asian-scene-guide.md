## Where we host in Melbourne

### Riverside lounges on the Yarra
We partner with heritage venues that mirror the elegance of The Stock Exchange Hotel – Level 2 in Brisbane. Expect city views, warm lighting, and attentive service.

### Hidden café salons
Melbourne’s laneways shelter tranquil cafés where conversation can flow. We reserve private rooms, provide bilingual hosts, and showcase Asian fusion desserts that match the Comfort and Romance theme.

## Signature experiences you will love

### Meet and taste flights
Guests sample regional teas or boutique wines while guided conversation cards help break the ice. Smart casual outfits keep the mood stylish yet relaxed.

### Creative workshops
Calligraphy, floral art, or dumpling design sessions let guests bond through shared craft. We still pause contact exchange during the event to protect fairness and comfort.

### Supper clubs with a twist
Multi-course dinners highlight Asian-Australian chefs. Between courses, our hosts spotlight the tagline “Connecting hearts across Asian cultures” to remind everyone why they are there.

## Prepare for your first Melbourne gathering

### Embrace smart casual elegance
Think tailored coats, silk scarves, and polished loafers—pieces that feel comfortable for a full evening but still photograph beautifully.

### Plan mindful travel
Many venues sit near tram lines or Flinders Street Station. Arriving a little early gives you time to breathe and settle.

### Honour the comfort principle
Leave business cards tucked away. Our team only shares contact details after the event when a mutual match is recorded.

## Reserve your invitation
Join our Melbourne waitlist to hear about launch dates first. When you book, our concierge will send outfit guidance, arrival notes, and gentle conversation starters so you can feel calm and confident.
